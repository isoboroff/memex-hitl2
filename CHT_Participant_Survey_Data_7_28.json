It lacks the ability to sort information easily and  view it clearly.  Some type of sorting ability (such as the one in tellfinder) would definitely make me want to use DIG more, especially as DIG extracts more useful information.  Tellfinder:  I think it should be easier to combine searches in Tellfinder.  For example, when searching, it would nice if I could select boxes/aspects to narrow my search further once I've done an initial search, instead of having to try and search everything together.Overall, I would probably try to use the two systems together; Tellfinder for my initial search, and DIG to narrow and hone my search."]
